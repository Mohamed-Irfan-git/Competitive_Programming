# Java Data Structures & Algorithms Repository 🧩

Welcome to my Java 17 DSA repository, a comprehensive collection of data structures, algorithms, and programming concepts 
implemented in Java. This repository is designed for beginners, intermediates, and enthusiasts who want to learn, practice, and master 
Java-based problem-solving techniques.

## 🚀 Features
This repository includes implementations for a wide range of topics:

### Data Structures
```bash
-> Array & ArrayList → Basic and advanced operations
-> Linked List → Single, double, circular linked lists
-> Stack & Queue → Classic stack and queue problems
-> Heap → Min-heap, max-heap, priority queue
-> Tree → Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversals
-> Graph → Graph representations, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.
-> Collections → Java Collections Framework usage
```
### Algorithms
```bash
-> Sorting → Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap sort
-> Search → Linear search, Binary search, and advanced search techniques
-> Greedy Algorithms → Interval scheduling, coin change, etc.
-> Dynamic Programming → Classic DP problems with explanations
-> Sliding Window & Prefix Sum → Optimization techniques for array problems
-> Bit Manipulation → Common bitwise problems
```
### Other Concepts
```bash
-> File Handling → Byte streams and file operations
-> Recursion → Examples of recursive solutions
-> Annotations → Basic Java annotations
-> Threading → Multi-threading and concurrency examples
-> Input Handling → Efficient input reading techniques
```
